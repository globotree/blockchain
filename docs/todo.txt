- balance calculation is flawed:
    - assumes transactions are mined right away
    - bug: A sends to B, then B sends to A, then mine transactions
        - will show improper balance for B because won't count the transfer from A which occured before B's Input Transaction was created

- balance calculation is inefficient
    - checks all transactions from entire blockchain - as blockchain grows, this becomes a slower process

- spending unconfirmed/unmined coins
    - if sender creates multiple transactions and sends funds to multiple recipients:
        - no mechanism in place to check if all the transfers together exceed his balance
        - only checking on each transaction to see if it's bigger than current balance
        - pending balance might be answers

- miner fee/transaction fee added to each transaction by the sender
